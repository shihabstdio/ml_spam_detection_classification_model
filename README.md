# Machine Learning Classification Projects

This repository contains multiple **Machine Learning classification projects** implemented in Python using popular libraries like **scikit-learn**, **pandas**, **seabon**, **matplotlib**, and **numpy**.
The projects demonstrate how to preprocess data, train classification models, and evaluate their performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Projects Included

1. **Iris Classifier**
   - Classifies iris flowers into species based on features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
   - Models used: Logistic Regression,KNN,SVM,Naive_bayes etc.

2. **Spam detection**
   - Classifies Spam or not-spam.
   - Model used: MultinomialNB.
   - Includes data preprocessing, feature encoding, and model evaluation.

3. **Titanic Survival Prediction**
   - Classifies based on passengers data

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling numerical features.
- **Model Training:** Implemented multiple classifiers to compare performance.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
- **Notebook Format:** All projects are provided in Jupyter Notebooks for easy experimentation.
